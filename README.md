# scale-app

A simple Qt app written in pyqt5 for logging bathroom scale data.

Inspired my the meme 'Excel is not a database', I created this GUI to replace my previous use of Excel for logging my bathroom scale data.

It inclues a number of useful features, such as automatically filling in the current days date and various error detection features.

Uses Pandas and a csv database for storing data.
